# gmod_e2_mecha
Gmod Mecha E2 that supports ACF

Mecha E2 made by Nexy STEAM_0:1:63923714, feel free to ask questions or make suggestions

Drop those 2 folders into your garrysmod/data folder
You need to spawn the e2 called "animation container" first and let it load all the animations
if you find the loading too slow, you can delete all the dances as they take the most space

To feed acf entities to the e2 for mecha duplication, you need to link "WeaponStockMarker" to a prop, the e2 will then search for any acf entity around that prop.
