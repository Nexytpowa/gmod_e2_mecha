Gmod Mecha E2 that supports ACF

Mecha E2 made by Nexy STEAM_0:1:63923714, feel free to ask questions or make suggestions

Drop these folders into your garrysmod/data folder.
You need to spawn the e2 called "animation container" first and let it load all the animations.
If you find the loading too slow, you can delete all the dance animations as they take the most space.

To feed ACF entities to the e2 for mecha duplication, you need to link "WeaponStockMarker" to a prop, the e2 will then search for any ACF entity around that prop.
Feel free to use the mecha template i've included for advanced duplicator 2
